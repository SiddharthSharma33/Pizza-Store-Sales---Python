Problem Statement: Pizza Sales Analysis

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the sales data from a pizza delivery business to uncover key insights that can drive business decisions. This includes understanding customer ordering patterns, identifying the most popular pizza types, and optimizing pricing strategies based on the analysis of historical sales data.

Background:
The pizza business has collected a substantial dataset comprising order details, including pizza types, quantities ordered, order dates and times, pricing, and other relevant information. However, the business has yet to fully leverage this data to understand customer behavior, optimize inventory management, or enhance marketing strategies.

Key Questions:
1. What are the most popular pizza types and sizes?
   - Identifying the top-selling pizzas by name and size will help in inventory planning and promotional efforts.
   
2. What are the average order size and order price?
   - Understanding these metrics will assist in setting realistic sales targets and evaluating the effectiveness of pricing strategies.
   
3. What is the distribution of orders across different days of the week and months?
   - Analyzing sales trends over time will help in optimizing staffing, promotions, and supply chain management.
   
4. What is the total number of orders, and on which date did the highest order volume occur?
   - Recognizing peak order days can help the business prepare for high-demand periods and prevent stockouts.

5. Are there any noticeable seasonal trends in ordering behavior?
   - Understanding seasonality can help in planning marketing campaigns and promotions effectively.

Scope:
This project will focus on analyzing the historical sales data to extract meaningful insights. The analysis will include visualizing the distribution of orders, identifying trends, and generating reports that can inform decision-making. The insights derived from this project will be crucial for optimizing operations, improving customer satisfaction, and increasing revenue.

Outcome:
The results of this analysis will provide actionable insights that can be used to:
- Improve inventory management by stocking the most popular ingredients.
- Develop targeted marketing campaigns to boost sales during slow periods.
- Optimize pricing strategies based on customer purchasing patterns.
- Enhance operational efficiency by aligning staffing with demand.

By addressing these key questions, the project aims to deliver a comprehensive understanding of the pizza business's sales dynamics, ultimately contributing to better decision-making and improved profitability.
